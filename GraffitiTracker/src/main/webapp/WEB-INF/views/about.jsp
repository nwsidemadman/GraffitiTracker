  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Two years after I bought my first home, I experienced an aspect of Chicago I had never encountered in my life: Gang Violence. This involved shootings on a weekly basis, in my gangway, in my alley, and elsewhere in my community.</p>
  <p>After the initial shock of what our community was up against, the neighborhood became united. And educated. And we saw patterns in gang activity emerge. Follow the gang based graffiti.</p>
  <p>Some Chicago street gangs use graffiti as territory markers, and to taunt rival gangs. If you follow the graffiti, you can forecast conflict. Both conflict timeframe and conflict location.</p>
  <p>I soon realized that my experience was not an isolated experience. Other Chicagoans are affected by gang violence. And many worse than what my community endured.</p>
  <p>And then an idea was born in my head. Use technology as a tool against this plague. Archive graffiti through multiple defined criteria that include date and location and other defining characteristics. Crowd source contributions and identifications. Plot this data on a map, and watch it move across the city like a weather pattern. Pay attention to graffiti density. Notice where one gang's graffiti crosses into a rival's territory. Connect this to open city data on violent crimes. And a bigger picture will emerge.</p>
  <p>There is no single cause of Chicago's gang violence problem. And there is no single solution for Chicago's gang violence problem. I am simply trying to offer another tool to assist combating this problem.</p>
  <p>Thank you for exploring and contributing to this site.</p>
